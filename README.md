# 📄 Document Chunking & Embedding with LangChain

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates a pipeline for processing text or PDF documents into vector embeddings suitable for retrieval-based AI applications.  

It is designed for developers and data scientists who want to build **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems, search engines, or any application that requires semantic search over documents.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Read and process **PDF** or **plain text documents**  
✅ Automatically **chunk documents** into smaller, overlapping text sections  
✅ Create **vector embeddings** using pre-trained language models  
✅ Store embeddings in a **FAISS vector database** for fast retrieval  
✅ Fully open-source and extensible for your own documents & models

---

## 📂 Project Structure



- **Notebook Name:** `RAG_BASIC`  
  The main notebook you’ll open and run step-by-step. It installs dependencies, loads your document, splits it into chunks, creates embeddings, and saves them to FAISS.
